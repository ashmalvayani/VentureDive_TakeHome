PROBLEM 1: CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS 
The dataset Class.csv contains 20 features that may or may not be useful for predicting the  labels column in Class.csv. No further information is available about the process that  generated the data. 
1) Put together an analysis of the dataset which identifies the following: a) Outliers 
b) Uninformative features 
c) Redundant features 
d) Imbalance 
Justify the methods used to answer the above question. 
2) Visualize the relationship between the informative features and the class labels 
3) Train a classifier to predict the labels from the provided features, assuming that each type  of misclassification error is equally costly. Clearly label each step of the process wrt your  findings from 1 above.  
4) Estimate the expected predictive accuracy of the trained classifier using an appropriate  metric.
